As an auditor, EY has to comply with strict procedures to ensure that we maintain independence from
any organisations we audit. Accordingly, we would be very grateful to receive PRs for bug fixes or
efficiency improvements to the existing code. New features should be added by forking this
repository.

The requirement to maintain independence is also the reason that we have waived all copyright and
placed the code in the public domain, rather than using a more conventional open source licensing
approach.
